<p><h2>Hammerhead Shark Fact</h2>
<br> They can’t see in front of them
Now, this isn’t to say that the hammerhead shark doesn’t have excellent vision. In fact, they can have a complete 360-degree range of vision. This means that they can see everything below them and everything above them. But in front of them? Not so well.
<br> The hammerhead shark’s hammer head is incredibly beneficial for hunting and surviving the depths of the ocean, but it does come with one disadvantage. Because of the positioning of their eyes, they have a blind spot right in front of their nose.
<br> However, other than this little hiccup in their vision, the hammerhead shark otherwise has great eyesight. They even have better depth perception than many other species of shark.
